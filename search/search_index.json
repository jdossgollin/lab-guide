Roles and responsibilities \u00b6 Contribute This is intended to be a living document and remains a work in progress. These expectations are negotiable; we can revise them before you join the lab and while you are here. Everyone \u00b6 Do work that you are proud of. Do work that others will care about. If you feel as though your work does not meet these standards, speak up Double-check your work. Being a little obsessive is essential to good science. Be supportive of your labmates. We are a team. Work independently when you can, ask for help when you need it. Share your knowledge. Exchanging knowledge and skills with your peers is the core of academic research. Respect each others' strengths, weaknesses, differences, and beliefs. Academia may feel different from other types of jobs, but it is still a job. You should treat coming into lab with the same respect that you would treat any other position. Communicate openly and respectfully with other members of the lab. If you have an issue with another lab member that cannot be solved by talking with them about it, please talk with James. If you have an issue with James, please reach out to another member of the department or the school of engineering. PI responsibilities \u00b6 As the group leader, James has a unique and challenging range of responsibilities. Build an Inclusive Environment: the PI is responsible for managing the social dynamic of the lab group to create a welcoming, inclusive, and productive environment. Define Research Directions for the Group: Finding research questions that are socially relevant and scientifically novel is one of the hardest and most important components of basic applied research. It requires an awareness of the overall state of knowledge in the field, creativity, and plenty of luck. Define the Technical Approach: Software and computing are very important to our group. The PI is working hard to provide a software and hardware environment that enables everyone else to be as productive as possible. Departmental Service: The PI has lots of responsibilities to the department, including attending department meetings, participating in committees, and serving on student masters meetings / qualifying exams / thesis proposals / thesis defenses. Provide Scientific Mentoring: It is the PI\u2019s responsibility to help the junior members in the group develop into mature, independent scientists, capable of defining and executing their own research programs. Lab members will meet annually to sketch a strategic plan for the academic year and regularly (for now, weekly) to stay in touch. Manage the Publication Process: Published papers are the main output of our team. The PI can help identify when results are ready to publish, select which journals to target, and help manage the ups and downs of the revision process. Obtain Funding: Scientific research is expensive! A central role of the PI is to obtain grant funding to support our work, without which no research could happen. Professional Service: The PI is expected to participate in professional organizations (e.g. AGU, AMS) and review papers and proposals on an ongoing basis. Provide Feedback: The PI is expected to provide feedback on all aspects of research, including defining hypotheses and formulating questions; identifying specific methods and technical approaches; identifying relevant datasets; writing and debugging scientific code; producing figures and visualizations; managing data; and writing and editing papers. Feedback is also available on course selection, overall career goals, and long-term strategy. Provide Material Support: You are never expected to spend any of your personal finances on anything related to research. All conference travel, computer supplies, books, etc. can be paid for with grant support (see item 2 above). Coordinate these expenses, in advance, with James. Provide Moral Support: Graduate school, and research in general, can be an emotional roller coaster. James has been through these challenges personally and is always available to listen and provide advice (though you should also see the Health Resources page). Provide Recommendation Letters: You need them for almost every career move. Set Goals and Timelines: The PI can help give structure to your project by defining specific milestones and timelines for their completion. Some people prefer to be closely managed in this way, while others may prefer a more hands-off approach. Sign Stuff: There are lots of signatures needed to navigate the bureaucracy. Teach Classes: The PI\u2019s main job is to teach at least one course for semester, which occupies a large fraction of available time and effort. Grad Student Responsibilities \u00b6 Heads up You shouldn't spend your own money on necessary work supplies. Talk to James to make sure you have the resources you need. Graduate students are both students and workers, leading to a complex range of responsibilities to manage. Ask Questions! If something is unclear to you -\u2013 either a science question or a procedural / administrative issue -\u2013 you should speak up. Develop Dissertation Research. Ideally, your dissertation research will consist of at least 3 experiments that can be packaged into one thesis document. Apply for External Funding. Applying to external funding (e.g., NSF GRFP) that you are eligible for is required of our graduate students, but even if it wasn\u2019t, I would recommend it because it is such a valuable learning experience. Be Professional and Organized: Develop a system that works for your for managing your responsibilities, coursework, and research. This is one of the biggest challenges of graduate school and there is no formula that works for everyone. Communicate with the group and attend group meetings. Develop a Research Plan: In consultation with your advisor, you should come up with a long-term plan for your research, with clearly defined milestones and goals. Each week, you should have a short term plan for exactly what to work on to move towards those goals. Develop Independence: Your goal is to become an independent scientist. This means you should not hesitate to pursue your own ideas as they arise. Go to as many talks as you can to learn new things! Read (and re-read) papers in your field and outside it. Download that dataset and analyze it! Run that new model! Don\u2019t wait to be told to do things. Take the initiative. Focus on your Research: Your research is the most important part of your grad school experience. It should be your main priority, and you should approach it with the seriousness and professionalism you would a full-time job. It is easy to get caught up in coursework or TA-ing, but at the end of 5-ish years, you need to have completed a dissertation. Produce Reusable Data / Software: In our group, we believe strongly that research is more than just papers. You are expected to share the outputs of your research (data and software) in a way that makes them reusable by the rest of the group and the rest of the field. See Open Science . Stay in Good Standing: it is YOUR responsibility to understand all of the formal requirements of the graduate school and the department, and to stay ahead of all deadlines regarding registration, paperwork, qualifying exams, committee meetings, etc. Stay on Top of your Coursework: The beginning of grad school is dominated by classes. You should strive to get as much as possible out of your coursework and connect it to your research wherever possible. Do Some Soul-Searching: it is your responsibility to think about what type of career you want to pursue (e.g., academic jobs that are research-focused or teaching-focused, non-academic jobs like data science or science writing). We can brainstorm ways of making sure you are getting the training that you need and exposure to paths that you may be interested in. Undergraduate Responsibilities \u00b6 Undergraduate students in the research group have a few core responsibilities. Learn Participate Meet college requirements Maintain average working rate of 10hrs/wk (unless otherwise discussed) Track time spent working honestly and accurately Plan for the future Explore many paths Submit weekly reports Attend lab meetings when possible Apply for scholarships, awards, and fellowships Be helpful, friendly, and open to new ideas","title":"Expectations and Responsibilities"},{"location":"expectations/#expectations-and-responsibilities","text":"Caveat Guidelines from Rice University, Rice Engineering, and Rice CEE take precedence over this section.

No project, paper, grant or collaboration exists that is more important than you. Graduate students and postdocs are exposed to a plethora of stress factors, resulting in consequences that can be mild to extremely severe. Quoting from the article Graduate School Can Have Terrible Effects on People's Mental Health : The doctoral-degree experience often consists of intense labor expectations for little pay and a resulting lack of sleep and social life. In addition, there is the notorious hierarchy of academia, which often promotes power struggles and tribalism.... Graduate students are disproportionately likely to struggle with mental-health issues. The researchers surveyed roughly 500 economics Ph.D. candidates at eight elite universities, and found that 18 percent of them experienced moderate or severe symptoms of depression and anxiety.

The vacation and workload expectations defined in Roles and Responsibilities are a big part of this. Some other tips, based on experience, are the following: Do not come into the lab if you are sick. Stay home and get healthy, and don't risk getting others sick. (This will continue to be important even if and when COVID-19 is a memory). Maintain a healthy sleep schedule. Pursue interests and hobbies outside of your work. These help relieve stress. They also benefit your research! Stepping away from your problem and letting your mind wander elsewhere is, counterintuitively, a great way to stimulate creative thought. Develop a support network among your peers.

The challenges of disease, poverty, education, social justice, and the environment are too urgent to waste time on studies lacking rigor, outcomes that are never shared, and findings that are not reproducible. In this spirit: We use open-source and reproducible tools so that that our peers can repeat, critique, and improve upon our work We communicate our findings and methods to our peers through open-access channels that facilitate intellectual progress We actively communicate findings of relevance to the public through a range of appropriate channels This page describes our approach to open science at a high level -- see the toolkit page to learn about specific tools we use. And don't worry if you're not familiar with all these tools; we'll teach you what you need to know \ud83d\ude09! Reproducible science \u00b6 Unless there are specific and compelling reasons (which should be documented and reviewed by peers), the necessary components of a scholarly work to provide reproducibility should be provided in a publicly accessible location and potentially as part of the scientific record. In the case of a simulation model, this would include: A specification of the computing environment The source code that ran the simulation The parameter file or definitions file, and if applicable initial conditions, that ran the simulation Analysis code that generated plots for the paper Timing \u00b6 Generally, we will make our data and code publicly available simultaneously with the submission of the paper to a peer-reviewed journal.

Include sufficient detail and reference to sources of information in a manuscript to permit the author\u2019s peers to repeat the work. Limitations on use of or access to data must be clearly identified.

Information obtained privately, as in conversation or correspondence, should not be used or reported without explicit permission from the source. Carefully document methodology, assumptions, and uncertainty. 1 Follow the appropriate procedures in force in their countries that govern the ethics of work done with human or animal subjects. Never plagiarize the work or ideas of others or your own work. Always provide appropriate citation. [The AGU provides further information on plagiarism, which you should read.] Avoid unnecessary fragmentation or redundant publication of research reports to artificially increase the number of publications. Never include personal criticism in a written piece of work. Report to the editor any changes made to the manuscript after acceptance.

Please see below for instructions. You may also benefit from the wisdom of the internet. For generic advice, check out: Matt Might's How to Get Into Grad School post (note that this is aimed at computer science, but is overall similar) this MIT guide to the personal statement Rice University's guidance to the personal statement Open Positions \u00b6 When funding is available for M.S. and Ph.D students to do specific work, these positions will be advertised on the group\u2019s \"Join\" page. When projects allow for a broader scope, or more general funding is available, that same page will note how many students the group is looking to take on. If you have external funding or a specific research idea, you can reach out (see below) even if there's not a position posted. How to Apply \u00b6 Apply to the program of your choice in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering . See Rice graduate admission guidelines . It is your responsibility to keep track of all required deadlines, materials, etc. What We're Looking For \u00b6 There are three main questions that your application needs to answer. Fundamentally, they're about making sure that if you join this group to do a PhD at Rice, you will be happy and successful. PhD students who are happy and successful are PhD students in a program that is a good fit for their skills and interests! Would doing this research advance your life/career goals? Do you have the required training and ability to carry out this research? Have you given clear thought to the skills you will need to acquire and do you have a plan for how you will obtain them? Am I the right supervisor for this research? Can the questions that you're interested in be answered using methods in which I have expertise? Although your application is assessed holistically, you should focus on crafting the personal statement to make sure that it clearly and obviously answers all three of these questions. Advancing your goals \u00b6 A PhD can be a long and tiring process. Happy and successful PhD students are those who can draw energy and support from the big picture. In your application, I'm looking to see: Have you thought clearly about your long-term goals? This doesn't have to be specific (\"I want to work at a particular national lab\") and you can express uncertainty (\"I am interested in developing a startup and in academia, and this PhD will prepare me for both while helping me decide\"). You should, of course, be interested in a career that involves research! I'm more interested in seeing evidence of a thoughtful process of discernment than in what your specific goals are. There isn't a \"right\" answer. Will the research projects I'm working on help you advance those goals? If your goal is to be an astronaut, this probably isn't a good fit. Background and training \u00b6 PhD students aren't expected to hit the ground running -- some coursework and training is necessary -- but having a strong background will help you transition quickly to interesting research projects and minimize frustrations. Strong applicants will have some exposure to the following skills, and will excel in at least one area. No one's perfect at everything, though! Writing and communication: Science requires a great deal of reading, writing, and presenting. Clear communication is a critical skill, especially in the age of information overload. This doesn't mean that you need to be the next Amanda Gorman, and it doesn't mean that if English is your second language you can't thrive. However, you should use your personal statement (and share work you've finished) to demonstrate your writing abilities. Programming: All the work we do involves computation and simulation. In our group we use mainly Python, R, and Julia, but experience in other languages will serve you well. If you've never programmed, consider taking a free online class to demystify coding and to make sure that you will be happy spending hours every day writing and editing code. Statistics, applied mathematics, and optimization: We use quantitative tools to characterize uncertainty and inform decisions. If you have a solid background in probability or statistics, it will help you hit the ground running. Coursework or skills in statistics, probability, econometrics, optimization, applied mathematics, water resources management, and similar fields will strengthen your application. Physical sciences: Understanding climate risk and how it might change in the future requires some basic understanding of physical processes. A background in earth science, environmental science, environmental engineering, physics, hydrology, or similar fields will help you examine present and future hydroclimate hazard. Critical thinking: A Ph.D. is a license to do independent research, which means you should be able to formulate and examine research questions, not just turn the crank. You should be able to tell a story about why you posed a particular question, how your prior understanding of the area led you to formulate certain hypotheses, how you designed your experiment to test those hypotheses, and what the implications of the results are for your hypotheses in particular and the field in general. This skill is hard to demonstrate, but you can show your abilities in your personal statement and in any subsequent interviews. If you are interested in our work but aren't sure whether you have a strong background, please reach out! (In particular, studies show that individuals from minoritized groups tend to underestimate their own abilities. Please don't sell yourself short!) Adviser fit \u00b6 \"Fit\" is a fluid concept that has often been used to justify implicit discrimination. That's not what we're about! However, it is important to consider whether Do your values align with ours? Is your preferred work style compatible with our guidelines? Will my expertise, as an adviser, and the projects we work on as a group advance your goals and satiate your intellectual curiousity? How To Send an Email Expressing Interest \u00b6 Putting together all the materials for a graduate application is a lot of work for you and your recommenders, and it costs money. If you are interested in applying but would like some feedback on whether you should apply, then: DO : read the lab guide and lab website before you send an email. DO NOT : Ask a question that is answered in the FAQs below. DO : attach your current CV (as a .pdf ), a statement of your research interests or draft of your personal statement, and any relevant prior work you'd like me to look at. DO : explain why you are reaching out to me specifically . DO : ask for feedback on specific questions. For example, if you ask \"are you still working on <some topic> \"? or \"do you have funding for students in the fall?\" or \"I'm very interested in using <method related to what I work on> ; is this something you use?\", then I can give you helpful feedback. If you ask \"should I apply?\" the answer will be \"it's up to you.\" It would be unfair and unethical for me to try to conduct admissions outside the context of the actual application process. FAQ \u00b6 Should I write a research proposal? \u00b6 The short answer: probably not. You should include some research goals and ideas in your personal statement, and that should be enough. It's better to have a very strong personal statement than a less strong personal statement plus a research proposal. The longer answer: if you have a clear and specific research proposal that effectively supplements your personal statement, demonstrates a clear understanding of the field, and outlines feasible research for which I would be a suitable mentor, then a research proposal can help you. However, since you are not expected to submit a research proposal, if you do submit one and it isn't strong, it could send a singal that you think you know more than you actually do. In general you're better off improving your personal statement than writing a research proposal. How is it the best way to find a master/Phd opportunity? \u00b6 When you're applying to an undergraduate program, you care the most about the university. When applying to a PhD (in engineering at least), you care the most about the research group you will be working with. Start by thinking about what kind of research you want to do. Do you like lab work or computational work? What problems do you want to use? What classes do you want to take? Sketch out some research ideas that interest you. Then, conduct a literature review and find out who is working in this space. Look at their web pages and papers and look for research groups that appeal to you. What are normally the deadlines of the applications? \u00b6 In general, programs in the US have a deadline in December or January for admission to the fall semester. Some programs have a deadline in the fall for admission to the spring semester.

Fundamentally, they're about making sure that if you join this group to do a PhD at Rice, you will be happy and successful. PhD students who are happy and successful are PhD students in a program that is a good fit for their skills and interests! Would doing this research advance your life/career goals? Do you have the required training and ability to carry out this research? Have you given clear thought to the skills you will need to acquire and do you have a plan for how you will obtain them? Am I the right supervisor for this research? Can the questions that you're interested in be answered using methods in which I have expertise? Although your application is assessed holistically, you should focus on crafting the personal statement to make sure that it clearly and obviously answers all three of these questions.","title":"What We're Looking For"},{"location":"policies/gradadmissions/#advancing-your-goals","text":"A PhD can be a long and tiring process. Happy and successful PhD students are those who can draw energy and support from the big picture. In your application, I'm looking to see: Have you thought clearly about your long-term goals? This doesn't have to be specific (\"I want to work at a particular national lab\") and you can express uncertainty (\"I am interested in developing a startup and in academia, and this PhD will prepare me for both while helping me decide\"). You should, of course, be interested in a career that involves research! I'm more interested in seeing evidence of a thoughtful process of discernment than in what your specific goals are. There isn't a \"right\" answer. Will the research projects I'm working on help you advance those goals? If your goal is to be an astronaut, this probably isn't a good fit.","title":"Advancing your goals"},{"location":"policies/gradadmissions/#background-and-training","text":"PhD students aren't expected to hit the ground running -- some coursework and training is necessary -- but having a strong background will help you transition quickly to interesting research projects and minimize frustrations. Strong applicants will have some exposure to the following skills, and will excel in at least one area. No one's perfect at everything, though! Writing and communication: Science requires a great deal of reading, writing, and presenting. Clear communication is a critical skill, especially in the age of information overload. This doesn't mean that you need to be the next Amanda Gorman, and it doesn't mean that if English is your second language you can't thrive. However, you should use your personal statement (and share work you've finished) to demonstrate your writing abilities. Programming: All the work we do involves computation and simulation. In our group we use mainly Python, R, and Julia, but experience in other languages will serve you well. If you've never programmed, consider taking a free online class to demystify coding and to make sure that you will be happy spending hours every day writing and editing code. Statistics, applied mathematics, and optimization: We use quantitative tools to characterize uncertainty and inform decisions. If you have a solid background in probability or statistics, it will help you hit the ground running. Coursework or skills in statistics, probability, econometrics, optimization, applied mathematics, water resources management, and similar fields will strengthen your application. Physical sciences: Understanding climate risk and how it might change in the future requires some basic understanding of physical processes. A background in earth science, environmental science, environmental engineering, physics, hydrology, or similar fields will help you examine present and future hydroclimate hazard. Critical thinking: A Ph.D. is a license to do independent research, which means you should be able to formulate and examine research questions, not just turn the crank. You should be able to tell a story about why you posed a particular question, how your prior understanding of the area led you to formulate certain hypotheses, how you designed your experiment to test those hypotheses, and what the implications of the results are for your hypotheses in particular and the field in general. This skill is hard to demonstrate, but you can show your abilities in your personal statement and in any subsequent interviews. If you are interested in our work but aren't sure whether you have a strong background, please reach out!

Funding \u00b6 The lab will typically pay for full-time lab members to present their work at major conferences (e.g., AGU, ASCE EWRI, etc.). In general, the work should be \"new\" in that it has not been presented previously, and it should be appropriate for the conference. This will usually result in one conference per year. If you wish to attend any other conference outside of these guidelines, the lab may be willing to reimburse you for the registration fee. Grant budgets typically estimate flights plus $200 per day for hotel and meal costs, so your reimbursable costs should be around that amount or less. If travel expenses are being paid off of a grant, additional restrictions may apply (talk to me). All of these guidelines, of course, depend on the availability of funds. Lab members are required to apply for other sources of funding available to them (e.g., departmental and university funds, conference student travel awards). Lab members may sometimes book shared accommodations (e.g, AirBnB) for travel. This can save money and be more pleasant than staying at a hotel.

Informal gatherings are also important for networking and can lead to future job offers and other opportunities. Unfortunately, uncomfortable and unsafe situations can arise in these settings, particularly where the power dynamics of academia are mixed with relaxed settings and alcohol. When traveling away from Rice University, group members should exercise caution to look after their own safety and that of other group members they are traveling with.

Specific positions for pay may be also advertised as announcements on the lab website . Research for Credit \u00b6 If you want to work in lab and earn course credit, you can sign up for undergraduate research (discuss CEVE 499 with a program administrator or adviser). We will have to fill out a syllabus contract at the beginning of the semester. Typically you would be in lab for at least 10 hours a week, and you would also be required to attend lab meetings, read a few papers, and complete a few short written assignments. You can enroll in undergraduate research multiple times, subject to the requirements of the University and your degree. To Apply : send me an email from your Rice University account: Put \"CEVE 499: Research for Credit\" in the subject line of the email, Attach your CV or resume (short is fine, undergrads don't need a 5 page CV!) as a .pdf file Attach a 1-2 page project proposal. The more detailed, the better (see below) as a .pdf file Suggest some times when you might be available to talk further in the body of the email. Senior Thesis Supervision \u00b6 If you are interested in having me supervise your senior thesis project, I recommend doing research for credit course during your sophomore or junior year. However, this is not a strict requirement (especially in 2021 since I'm new here!!) To Apply : as above (to do research for credit) but put \"Senior Thesis Supervision\" in the subject line of the email. Research for Pay \u00b6 If you want to work in lab and earn money, there are two different options. The lab can pay you as a research assistant, typically 5-10 hours per week at $12 per hour or as discussed. We have a limited number of hours available each semester, so these positions are competitive. Open positions may be posted on our lab website , but if you have concrete ideas you can propose a project (see below). We can apply for an undergraduate research fellowship to fund your time in lab. See the Student Opportunity Center for information. Because these fellowships are intended to support your academic development, undergraduate fellows will be required to participate in lab meetings. This option is also available during the summer. To Apply : as above (to do research for credit) but put \"Research for Pay\" in the subject line of the email. Volunteer Research \u00b6 Unpaid internships give an unfair advantage to those who can afford to volunteer their time and contribute to unequal representation in the field. We do not take unpaid volunteers as research assistants in our lab, except for academic credit. How To \u00b6 Write a Project Proposal \u00b6 A project proposal is a first draft of a semester research plan that we will craft together. This document will lay out research questions, research goals, research milestones and timelines, the tools you will need to carry out the research, and the mentoring and guidance you will need. As you write the first draft, your main goal is to convince me that you've thought about what research you want to do, that this research serves some intellectual or career goals that you have, that you have most of the skills you will need to do it, and that it's something that I would be well suited to supervise. Some things that I'm looking for when reading a project proposal are: Is the research feasible? (Do you have the skills needed? Do I have the resources needed?) Is the research interesting? Do you have a sense of previous work in this area? Are there social, policy, or technical implications? Are you going to be motivated? Does this advance real goals that you have?

Julia tries to solve the two-language problem, in which researchers typically prototype new methods and algorithms in a high-level language (python, R, etc) and then painstakingly port them to performant and scalable languages (Fortran, C++, etc) to run research-scale simulations and analyses. For more read the Nature hype piece . Julia is an ideal language for many of the problems we work on because we can write system models in Julia that integrate seamlessly with optimization and analysis tools. It's also easy to develop methods and algorithms. There are some use cases where it's easier to use existing tools in Python or R than to redevelop things in Julia (for example, analysis of large gridded climate data is much easier in Python using Pangeo 's toolkit), but Julia should generally be the first tool you turn to. If you are going to build true expertise in just one language, it should be Julia. Julia is still a bit new, so there aren't a lot of great resources for learning. However, you should start with MIT's Intro to Computational Thinking course.

This provides you with the conda package manager, which you can use to create Python \"environments\" on your computer. Conda is a package manager used to manage dependencies for python projects (and also R and other programs). A key feature of conda is that you can create many different environments, each of which has different sets of packages. Although you can also install packages and create environments using other tools, conda has lots of advantages.
