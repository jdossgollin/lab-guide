See Rice graduate admission guidelines. It is your responsibility to keep track of all required deadlines, materials, etc!\n\nBefore formally applying\nApplying to graduate school is a time- and money-consuming process. You are strongly encouraged (though not required) to reach out before formally applying as this can help to give both of us a sense of whether it’s worth the investment of your time to apply.\nTo reach out, please read the instructions below and then fill out this form. If you send me an email, you will get a template email directing you to fill out the form. I get too many emails from prospective students to keep track of all of them effectively.\n\nDecide if you are interested\n\nRead relevant websites and our papers to judge whether this is a good fit.\nNote the kind of quantitative research we do, the approaches we use, and the problems we analyze.\nFeel free to explore websites of coauthors and close collaborators.\nReview the core values we adopt in the lab group (described int his document) and decide whether they are compatible with your values and goals.\n\nFill out the form” If you are still interested and see the potential for a good fit, fill out the form for prospective applicants.\n\nThis form asks for a statement of purpose. See “how to write a good application” for some helpful tips on how to write a good one! Statements that do not follow these tips are unlikely to stand out and will probably not lead to you being accepted.\nFill out all requested questions thoughtfully. I suggest to draft text inputs in another application so that if your internet connection is disrupted nothing is lost.\nI will follow up via email.\n\nVideo chats If, after you fill out the form, there are clear synergies between your interests and the group’s, we will schedule a video chat.\n\nThese are intended to evaluate your verbal communications skills and how well you can articulate your interests. If a video chat does not work for you, we can find alternatives.\nThere is no need for fancy backgrounds, formal presentations, or for dressing up.\nIf this is of joint interest, you should apply formally to the department (see next)\n\n\n\n\nThe formal application\nWhether you have been in touch or not, you must apply to the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice. This will give the department an opportunity to view your transcripts, letters of recommendation, and statement of purpose. Of these, the step you most control is the statement of purpose; see below for tips on information on how to write a strong statement of purpose that enhances your chances of admission.\nAfter formal applications are submitted, I will follow up with information on a formal interview.",

    "section": "FAQ",
    "text": "FAQ\nAre positions fully funded?\nIn short: yes. All Ph.D. positions within the group will be fully funded. That includes tuition support, a stipend, and other benefits – see Rice’s 2022 Announcement. You will get more details in your formal offer letter if accepted.\nShould I write a research proposal?\nYou should include some research goals and ideas in your statement of purpose, but don’t write a separate research proposal. See the advice listed above for more details.\nHow is it the best way to find a master/Phd opportunity?\nWhen you’re applying to an undergraduate program, you care the most about the university. When applying to a PhD (in engineering at least), you care the most about the research group you will be working with.\nStart by thinking about what kind of research you want to do. Do you like lab work or computational work? What problems do you want to use? What classes do you want to take? Sketch out some research ideas that interest you. Then, conduct a literature review and find out who is working in this space. Look at their web pages and papers and look for research groups that appeal to you.\nHow often do students usually travel for conferences?\nAfter the first year (primarily classes) I aim to fund students to go to the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting (1 week in December) or the American Society of Civil Engineers Environment / Water Resources Institute annual meeting (1 week in May). There are also lots of smaller and more targeted workshops that are often great experiences – they often have some student travel grants and with planning we can often fund student travel.\nWhat are things you wish more students knew before joining your program?\nI got some feedback from current students for this.\n\nBalancing course requirements (roughly 6 courses – see student handbook for details) and research can be a challenge, especially for first-year graduate students who generally have the heaviest courseloads.\nFor anyone doing modeling or data-driven work, most of your day will be spent (i) reading, (ii) writing, or (iii) coding. You should strive to improve your effectiveness in all three areas and plan to spend much of your day at a computer (which also means being deliberate about getting out of your computer!)\nYou will get more out of grad school (this applies to any program!) if you have a clear idea of what you want to learn and what you want to get out of grad school.\n\nWhat is the worst quality of life pain point that your students go through?\nI got some feedback from current students for this.\n\nTrying to learn how to do research while also taking a heavy courseload can make for a tough first semester (this was also my experience).\n\nHow has the lab planned and handled for student’s growth throughout their graduate program?\nI got some feedback from current students for this. We’re still figuring this out and will continue to adapt as we learn more. Students learn best from each other, so we have regular reading groups, where we meet (often with friends from other groups) to discuss papers. We help each other prepare for conferences, give each other feedback on papers, etc. This only works in an environment where we trust each other (both giving and getting feedback require trust) so we need to hold ourselves and each other to a high standard of integrity (i.e., be trustworthy!) As a young / small group, it’s also important to have interaction with people outside the group – we have meetings and social events with other lab groups, and most students are working on collaborative projects that include people from beyond our group.\nHow are publication credits discussed in the lab?\nPlease see authorship guidelines. Journals typically have clear expectations about what constitutes authorship and we follow those guidelines. The most important rule is to have clear conversations about authorship early on (this is the PI’s responsibility but students are always welcome to ask about authorship!)\nHow has the lab dealt with academic and social misconduct situations (plagiarism, bullying, harassment, misogyny, racism, transphobia, etc)?\nSo far we’ve been fortunate to have avoided significant academic and social misconduct. We obviously follow Rice University policies. We’ve also developed a policy on harassment and other expectations that will guide us if (when) these come up. In general we set high expectations for ourselves and for one another because a collaborative and open environment, which benefits everyone, requires mutual trust and respect.",

    "text": "Everyone\n\nEnvironment: Foster a supportive team environment committed to mutual learning and success. Support and help your labmates. Read and follow lab guidelines, suggesting improvements when you see opportunities. Take initiative in your work and in advancing the lab’s mission.\nWorkload: Treat your research as a full-time job, aiming for an average of 40 hours per week. This approach ensures consistent progress while allowing you to benefit from the flexibility academic research offers.\nPresence: Be an active participant in the lab. Attend and contribute to group meetings and seminars, taking turns to lead discussions. Be present in the lab during agreed times and respect shared spaces.\nManage Up: You are responsible for managing your relationship with your advisor(s). Schedule and lead regular 1:1 meetings, preparing agendas and following up on action items. Communicate your needs, goals, and challenges clearly. Seek feedback proactively, propose solutions rather than just problems, and provide respectful feedback on your working relationship.\n\n\nOpen Science\nOpen science is the idea that scientific research should be transparent and accessible to everyone, especially including the taxpaying public that funds a substantial portion of our research. Open science is about democratizing knowledge and accelerating scientific progress to address urgent challenges like climate change, flooding, and poverty. Some key concepts of open science are:\n\nReproducibility: This means obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, methods, code, and conditions of analysis.\nReplicability: This involves obtaining consistent results across different studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each with its own data.\nAccessibility: Making research findings, data, and methods available to all levels of society, both amateur and professional.\n\nImplementing this takes skills, and it’s James’s responsibility to provide training and resources to help you develop them, but committing to these principles is everyone’s responsibility. For example:\n\nWe make our data, code, and computational environments publicly available, typically no later than the publication of our work.\nWe prioritize using fully open-source tools whenever possible. When proprietary software or data is necessary, we document its use clearly and provide alternatives where possible.\nWe publish in open-access journals where appropriate and make post-prints freely available when not. We also share preprints on open-access servers.\nWe summarize our findings in non-technical blog posts, translate papers as needed, and use social media to share key findings.\nWe use permissive open-source licenses for our code, respecting and complying with licensing terms.\nWe employ various tools to facilitate reproducible science, including Python, Julia, Git, GitHub, Snakemake, Zenodo, and more.\n\n\n\nHealth and Well-being\nAcademia can be stressful, and it’s important to take care of yourself. Here are some tips:\n\nMaintain a healthy sleep schedule.\nPursue interests and hobbies outside of work to relieve stress and stimulate creative thought.\nDevelop a support network among your peers who understand the challenges.\nUse mental health resources when needed. Seeking help is a worthy investment in yourself.\nStay home when sick to protect your health and that of others.\nTake advantage of Rice’s mental health resources:\n\nWellbeing and Counseling Center\nCounseling Center",

    "text": "Openings and Applying\nThere are three main ways to do research as an undergraduate:\n\nFor credit\nAs a senior thesis\nFor pay\n\nPlease see the lab website’s “Join Us” page for advertised positions, although you’re always welcome to reach out if you have a specific idea (see below). Specific positions for pay may be also advertised as announcements on the lab website.\n\nResearch for Credit\nIf you want to work in lab and earn course credit, you can sign up for undergraduate research (discuss CEVE 499 with a program administrator or adviser). We will have to fill out a syllabus contract at the beginning of the semester. Typically you would be in lab for at least 10 hours a week, and you would also be required to attend lab meetings, read a few papers, and complete a few short written assignments. You can enroll in undergraduate research multiple times, subject to the requirements of the University and your degree.\nTo Apply: send me an email from your Rice University account:\n\nPut “CEVE 499: Research for Credit” in the subject line of the email,\nAttach your CV or resume (short is fine, undergrads don’t need a 5 page CV!) as a .pdf file\nAttach a 1-2 page project proposal. The more detailed, the better (see below) as a .pdf file\nSuggest some times when you might be available to talk further in the body of the email.\n\n\n\nSenior Thesis Supervision\nIf you are interested in having me supervise your senior thesis project, I recommend doing research for credit course during your sophomore or junior year. However, this is not a strict requirement (especially in 2021 since I’m new here!!)\nTo Apply: as above (to do research for credit) but put “Senior Thesis Supervision” in the subject line of the email.\n\n\nResearch for Pay\nIf you want to work in lab and earn money, there are two different options. The lab can pay you as a research assistant, typically 5-10 hours per week at $12 per hour or as discussed. We have a limited number of hours available each semester, so these positions are competitive. Open positions may be posted on our lab website, but if you have concrete ideas you can propose a project (see below).\nWe can apply for an undergraduate research fellowship to fund your time in lab. Because these fellowships are intended to support your academic development, undergraduate fellows will be required to participate in lab meetings. This option is also available during the summer.\nTo Apply: as above (to do research for credit) but put “Research for Pay” in the subject line of the email.\n\n\nVolunteer Research\nUnpaid internships give an unfair advantage to those who can afford to volunteer their time and contribute to unequal representation in the field. We do not take unpaid volunteers as research assistants in our lab, except for academic credit.",

This document will lay out research questions, research goals, research milestones and timelines, the tools you will need to carry out the research, and the mentoring and guidance you will need. As you write the first draft, your main goal is to convince me that you’ve thought about what research you want to do, that this research serves some intellectual or career goals that you have, that you have most of the skills you will need to do it, and that it’s something that I would be well suited to supervise. Some things that I’m looking for when reading a project proposal are:\n\nIs the research feasible? (Do you have the skills needed? Do I have the resources needed?)\nIs the research interesting? Do you have a sense of previous work in this area? Are there social, policy, or technical implications?\nAre you going to be motivated? Does this advance real goals that you have?\nAm I the right mentor for this work? Do I have the skills and resources needed to support you?\nDoes this research advance my goals?1",
